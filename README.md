# node-login
Login form using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, and SQLite

In February 2023, I became interested in NodeJS and SQLite, the latter of which I have some degree of prior experience with. I decided to create this project that would allow users to create and log in to accounts, with the details stored in a SQLite database. 

**Current functionality**

* Create an account
* Login to an account
* Hashed passwords
* Remember Me checkbox when signing in
* Delete account

**Planned for the future**

* Edit account details
* Email verification (this will probably come last)

While I do not plan on going further with this project beyond those things planned for the future, I may use this as a base for future projects that involve storing a user's information.
